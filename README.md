Now graphql is configured, you can play with the api at localhost:4000

## 1️⃣ Part 2 

In the last branch we initialize the mongoose Model, and the GraphQL Schema for **User**

Now in this part you can add all your entities to match with the specification.

Create the **Project** and **Task** part.  

> ⚠️ If you choose to change the subject of the final project, you can replace the following entities by yours. ⚠️ 


```
📁 Model - Mongoose (Database)
     📃 User
     📃 Project
     📃 Task
     
📁 Schema - GraphQL Schema ( Typedefs & Resolvers )
     📃 User.schema
     📃 Project.schema
     📃 Task.schema
```
